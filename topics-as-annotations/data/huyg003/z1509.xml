<p>Till you returne this letter<note n="#2"/> I will not answere it, and by that time I think you will haue seen Hook and may impart to him what Zulichem sayes, and I intend to send you my answer<note n="#3"/> open and with it you may say<note n="#4"/> what you find I do not, &amp; refer to you. Let me know if you have seen all the papers hee mentions. I think it were not amiss to put what concernes the Telescopes and discoveries in Jupiter in your Transactions philosophical<note n="#5"/> picking out between the marks I haue put what is fit to be said, but nameing neither Zulichem nor me though the rest there mentioned you may if you please. Send this book when you have done with it &amp; let our president<note n="#6"/> know what is in it, or if you please, send it to him, &amp; bid him send it to me.</p>
