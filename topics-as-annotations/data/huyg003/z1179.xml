<p>Sir,</p>
</div>
<p>J hope that long before this time, you have received mine<note n="#1"/> of the 29 th. of October Styli veteris wherein you will find that J deale as freely with you as J think a True Friend is obliged to doe in such a case, And that although J doe not complement yet J doe in that letter really shew you the Truth of the Case; And J make no doubt, but if you can not yet quiet your selfe, till your Admiration hath produced something more than two Good Pictures<note n="#2"/>; you will then [but perhaps with Trouble] find that there is as much Follie for a Lining within, as Beautie for a Covering without. And that therefore the Doctrine of Praeexistence will [notwithstanding that Jnstance] remaine unshaken. Within these three dayes she utterly denied that she had received any Letters from Monsieur H. being asked of it by the By, and not being told that he had at all written to her since he left London.</p>
<p>J find by Sir Robert Moray that he hath given<note n="#3"/> you a particular accompt of what is worth your knowing from the Royall Societie where J have not beene able to attend of late, having beene hindered by Sicknes and domestick Affaires which now force me to take a iourney into the Countrey, but if you direct your letters, as in my former J desired you would, to Mister John Lindsay Goldsinith at the Angell &amp; Crowne in Lombard-street, they will come safe to me. The Book J promised you is not yet Published, but by that time J returne to London, J hope J may be able to give you a better Accompt of that, and of the Success of the Restorative<note n="#4"/> J told you of, which J am so little afraid of (&amp; that, upon some grounds) that J dare as readily trie it upon my selfe as upon a Dog.</p>
<p>J hope you will continue your Kindness to me in letting me heare from you when you have leisure &amp; J hope J may at length be able to acquaint you with
something which will give you some satisfaction, J having a great &amp; reall Honor for you, and shall allwaies shew my selfe</p>
