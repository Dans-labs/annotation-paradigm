<p>The Publisher of Transations in that of <hi rend="i">October</hi> 1675. indeavours to cover former injuries done me by accumulating new ones, and this with so much passion
as with integrity to lay by discretion; otherwise he would not have affirmed, that it was as certain that none of my Watches succeeded, as it was that I had made them several years ago; For how could he be sure of a Negative? Whom I have not acquainted with my Inventions, since I looked on him as one that made a trade of Intelligence.</p>
<p>Next where as he says I made them without publishing them to the world <hi rend="i">in Print</hi>, he prevaricates, and would have it believed that they were not published to the world, though they were publickly read of in Sir <hi rend="i">John Gutlers</hi> Lectures before great numbers at several times, and though they were made and shewn to thousands both English and Foreiners, and writ of to several persons absent, and though they were in the year 1665. in the History of the <hi rend="i">Royal Society</hi> published to the world in Print<note n="#2"/> because forsooth, they were not printed in his Transactions.</p>
<p>Thirdly, whereas the Publisher of Transactions makes a long story of my seeing in his Journal <hi rend="i">De SÃ§avans</hi>, and my desire to transcribe that part of it which concerned this matter, as if I had requested some singular favour thereby. I answer,</p>
<p>First that he knew I designed presently to have printed it with Animadversions, but he endeavoured to prevent me, designing first clancularly to get a Patent of it for himself, and thereby to defraud me.</p>
<p>Next, I say, I had a right without his favour to have seen, perused, and copied it, as I was one of the <hi rend="i">Royal Society</hi>, the intelligence he there brings in being the <hi rend="i">Societies</hi>.</p>
<p>Then it is denied that the Describer of Helioscopes well knew that the Transcriber of Intelligence would publish it in his Transactions, though it was believed if the publishing it would injure me it would not be long concealed; which was the sole reason of Printing in the same Transactions, <hi rend="i">viz.</hi> 112. a Letter which he had several years before<note n="#3"/>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, whereas he asserts that several discourses of the Accuser had been vindicated from the usurpation of others. It is answered, the clean contrary is upon good grounds suspected from the Publication of a Book about Earthquakes, Petrifactions, &amp;<hi rend="i">c</hi>. Translated and Printed by H.O. the manner of doing which is too long for this place. Such ways this mis-informer hath for vindicating discoveries from the usurpation of others<note n="#4"/>.</p>
<p>To his upbraiding me with his having published some things of Mine; I answer, he hath so, but not so much with mine as with his own desire, and if he send me what I think worth publishing I will do as much for him, and repay him in his own coyn.</p>
<p>Lastly whereas he makes use of We and Us ambiguously, it is desired he would explain whether he means the <hi rend="i">Royal Society</hi>, or the Pluralities of himself. If the former, it is not so, as I can prove by many Witnesses; if the later, I neither know what he is acquainted with, or what has been imparted or explained to him.</p>
<p>So not designing to trouble my self any further with him, unless he gives me occasion, I dismiss him with his:</p>
