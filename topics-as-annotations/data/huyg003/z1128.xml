<p>London, ye 22 June, 1663.</p>
<p>Sir,</p>
</div>
<p>Your receipt for Monsieur Monconis came, after he had taken his leave from us: but I shall not faile, God permitting, to send it after him by ye first conveniency. On Wednesday last<note n="#1"/> there were admitted into ye Society My Lord Craford Lindsey<note n="#2"/>, Mcssieurs Hugens and Sorbiere. An experiment was tried in ye compressing engine, but again without successe; ye force of ye Air, thrust in, breaking ye cement, that fastned ye Glasse.</p>
<p>In ye experiment of ye precedent meeting<note n="#3"/> (whereof, no doubt, you had an account from Mister Hook) ye Air, put into ye place of ye Buble, remaining in one bolthead, was vanisht as well, as the Buble<note n="#4"/>, that was left in ye other bolthead. After this, petrifications were again discoursed off; and ye colors of insects: There were also a couple of letters read, sent to me, one from de la Quintinye<note n="#5"/>, containing a further account of melons; ye other from Mister Beale<note n="#6"/>, relating his observations of ye smut of corne. I had a third letter from Paris, written by ye same gentleman<note n="#7"/>, that is ye author of ye discourse <hi rend="i">de Calore</hi><note n="#8"/>, and hath so particular an esteeme for you, as I mentioned sormerly<note n="#9"/>. He tells me
now, that
ye King of France hath bestowed a largesse<note n="#10"/> of 80000 livres upon severall learned men, but most Poets and Romancers, except Huygenius and Hevelius, and La Chambre<note n="#11"/>; having neglected Roberval, Fermat, Frenicle, Rohaut, Ozou<note n="#12"/>, and such like, qui colunt Musas severiores.</p>
<p>This friend sheweth himselfe so much concerned for you, that he writeth thus: <hi rend="i">Il faut plus attendre de Monsieur Boyle</hi>, <hi rend="i">à mon advis, que de tous les autres ensemble: c'est pourquoy je suis fort affligé de ce qui le menace</hi><note n="#13"/>. <hi rend="i">Exhortez le puissemment à avoir soin de sa santé: je suis persuadé</hi>, <hi rend="i">que s'il s'y applique</hi>, <hi rend="i">il fortifiera sa constitution</hi>, <hi rend="i">et se garentira d'une maladie lente. Un de mes amis</hi>, <hi rend="i">avec qui je plaignois ce malheur</hi>, <hi rend="i">m'a assuré</hi>, <hi rend="i">qu'un seigneur Anglois</hi>, <hi rend="i">menacé de mesme</hi>, <hi rend="i">fut conseille de passer en France</hi>, <hi rend="i">ou l'air seul restablit si bien sa santé apres quelque sejour</hi>, <hi rend="i">qu'il retourna en Angleterre</hi>, <hi rend="i">sans qu'il retombat de sa vie en aucun peril de sa premiere maladie. Proposez luy la chose: il pourra philosopher partout</hi>, <hi rend="i">et faire provision de santé pour philosopher plus long temps</hi>.</p>
<p>You see, Sir, his kindnes for ye advantage of your health, though such absence would turn to ye disadvantage of your friends here, pro tempore.</p>
<p>He prayeth me, to entreat you to communicate unto him, if it may be, ye way, which Dr. Willis<note n="#14"/> mentions in his treatise de Fermentatione<note n="#15"/>, page 64. (supposing, your curiosity hath prompted you to get it from ye said author) videlicet to draw without any corrosive, <hi rend="i">solo calore lento</hi>, the tinctures of bodies with all their vertu. I dare engage for him, as well as for myselfe, that it shall remain a secret, if it be one.</p>
<p>There is going for France a friend of mine, by whom I could send a good packet, with safety; if you should think fit to present Monsieur Thevenot<note n="#16"/>, ye author of ye late voyages<note n="#17"/> in French, with one of your books<note n="#18"/>, of ye Usefulnes of natural philosophy, be understanding English pretty well; I intend also,
God willing, to send him one of your Latin reply<note n="#19"/> to Linus<note n="#20"/> and another to Monsieur Martel, the writer of ye forementioned discourse of heat. For this cause, have I taken two or three exemplars of this latter piece from Mister Crook<note n="#21"/>, supposing your leave to do so; that I might not neglect so fair an opportunity of sending, as is now offred to,</p>

<p>Sir

<p>The friend, that is going for France, purposeth to go hence on Friday next.</p>
