<p>Sir</p>
</div>
<p>as yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> highly obliged me by yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> taking notice of so vnworthy a person as J am in a letter to the worthy Gent. Mr. <persName key="olde010">Oldenburgh</persName><note n="#1"/>: so let me tell yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> that yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haue cast the same obligation vpon the whole world, whom yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haue astonished to an amazement by yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> happy and rare invention of the Pendulum, by which yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> haue contributed so much to the advance [me] nt of mankind whether in relation to their divine or morall concernments that I know not what Trophy adaequate or proportionable to yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> meritt can be erected for yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi>. And one thing further I cannot choose but take notice off that yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> were desig'nd not onely the first Inventor but also at one and the same time the finisher of so happy an invention; where by yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> seeme to haue contradicted that known maxime Nihil simul et natum et perfectum esse.</p>
<p>The Particulars yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> mentioned in the foresaid letter concerning Perspective were two. First that you would willingly be informed what successe I had found in grinding of Glasses not sphaericall, and secondly that it would be esteemed no small secrett to render the sphaericall, superficies perfect &amp; wel polish't. In order to the first I haue assum'd the confidence to present vnto yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> more critical and mature iudgment a Specimen of the true Figure plano-convex fitted to a Focus of about 3 inches and its Aperture 1 inch, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is 8 or 9 times greater then the best sphaericall glasse can possibly admit of. As to the second particular, I haue sent likewise another plano-convex fitted neer vpon to the same focus of a superficies (if I may say it) perfectly sphaericall and truly pollished vp to the edges from off the Tool which vpon larger segments of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sphaere (as I conceiue) has not hitherto by any bene acurately and faithfully performed, both w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I hope may render their severall effects somewhat considerable in their proper applications. Now Sr giue me leaue onely to add thus much to what I haue imparted to yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> that as I shall liue in the admiration of yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> trancendent gifts &amp; faculties, so I shall euer remain in a cheerfull readinesse to serue yo<hi rend="sup">u</hi> by my pen here, whilst I am debarr'd by an vnhappy distance of place from the enjoyment of the presence of
so renown'd a person as yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> self, a free converse w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> whom, would add much to my content and happinesse who am</p>
