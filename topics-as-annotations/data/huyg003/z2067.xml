<p>I Should have here taken leave of my Reader for this time, but that finding in the <hi rend="i">Transactions</hi><note n="#2"/> a passage inserted out of the <hi rend="i">French</hi> Journal <hi rend="i">de Scavans</hi><note n="#3"/>, about the invention of applying <hi rend="i">a Spring to the Ballance of a Watch for the regulating the motion thereof</hi>, without at all taking notice that this Invention was <hi rend="i">first</hi> found out by an <hi rend="i">English</hi>-man, and long since <hi rend="i">published to the World:</hi> I must beg the Readers patience, whilst I, in vindication of my own right against some unhandsome proceedings, do acquaint him with the state of this matter.</p>
<p>About <hi rend="i">seventeen years since</hi>, being very inquisitive about the <hi rend="i">regulating the measure of Time</hi>, in order to <hi rend="i">find the Longitude</hi>, I did from an Art of Invention, or mechanical <hi rend="i">Algebra</hi><note n="#4"/> (which I was then Master of) find out and perfect this
contrivance, both as to the Theory and Experimental verification thereof, of which I then discoursed to <hi rend="i">divers of my Friends</hi> but concealed the <hi rend="i">modus</hi>.</p>
<p>About fifteen years since, to wit, in the year 1660, presently after his Majesties happy Restauration, I was in treaty with several Persons of Honour<note n="#5"/> (some of which are yet living, though <hi rend="i">one</hi> of them is <hi rend="i">since dead</hi><note n="#6"/>, but I have sufficient evidence to produce in his own writing that he was one) for the discovery thereof, upon proposed Articles of encouragement. This I can prove by <hi rend="i">undeniable</hi> Witnesses yet living and I have still all the Papers, Articles, and Transactions of this matter by me, in their own hand-writing.</p>
<p>In order to bring this Treaty to pass, I was necessitated to discover something of [my] Invention about <hi rend="i">measuring Time</hi>, which was, this way of applying <hi rend="i">Springs to the arbor of the Ballance of a Watch, for the regulating the vibrations thereof in all postures</hi>. And this I did, to the end that I might gain somewhat of belief in those Noble Persons (with whom I was to treat) That I had somewhat more than ordinary, and was not one of the heard-of Pretenders to that Invention: which effect it had, and their Treaty with he had finally been concluded for several Thousand pounds, had not the inserting one Clause broke it off, which was, <hi rend="i">That if after I had discovered my Inventions about the finding the Longitude by Watches, or otherwise (though in themselves sufficient) They, or any other Person should find a way of improving my Principles, he or they should have the benefit thereof, during the terms of the Patent, and not I</hi>. To which Clause I could no waies agree, knowing 't was easie to vary my Principles a hundred waies, and 'twas not improbable but that there might be made some addition of conveniency to what I should at first discover, it being <hi rend="i">facile Inventis addere</hi><note n="#7"/>. And judging it most unreasonable to be deprived of the benefit os my Inventions, in
themselves sufficient, because others might vary them, or any other ways improve them, of which it was very probable they would have no thought, if they had not the advantage of being instructed by my discovery, it having lain hid some thousands of years already, as indeed the effect hath made evident and certain, there having been nothing done by any body else upon that matter for these fifteen years.</p>
<p>Upon this point our Treaty was broken off, and I concealed the farther discovery of the other more considerable parts of my Inventions, for the regulating of <hi rend="i">Time-Keepers</hi>, as hoping I might find some better opportunity of publishing them together with my way of finding the <hi rend="i">Longitudes of Places</hi>, for which I hoped to have had some benefit for all the labour, study, and charge I had been at for the perfecting thereof. Upon this I was told, <hi rend="i">That I had better have then discovered all, since there were others that would find it out within six months</hi>, to which I answered, that <hi rend="i">I would try them one seven years;</hi> and it is now about twice seven, and I do not find it yet found out. Indeed Mr. <persName key="huyg003">Hugens</persName> hath made use of that part I discovered, and somewhat Mr. <persName key="leib013">Leibnitz</persName><note n="#8"/> hath hit upon, but both of them are imperfect as I shall hereafter shew<note n="#9"/>.</p>
<p>'T is true, I was alarum'd by one of those Persons about two years after that, who told me, <hi rend="i">That he had news that the</hi> Longitude <hi rend="i">was found out by a Person of Honour</hi><note n="#10"/>, <hi rend="i">by a way of carrying Mr.</hi> Hugens's <hi rend="i">Pendulum-Clock, at Sea, by the help of a Ball and Socket, hung to the underside of the Deck of a Ship</hi>. But having a description of it, I presently told that Person, That <hi rend="i">that invention would do mine no harm;</hi> and indeed we experimentally found it useless to that effect not long after, upon a trial made of carrying the said Clocks off to Sea in one of His Majesties <hi rend="i">Pleasure-Boats</hi>, in the year 1662.</p>
<p>The invention indeed in it self was ingenious, and did much more than what Mr. <persName key="huyg003">Hugens</persName> did expect, as I was then informed by the Right Honourable the Earl of <hi rend="i">Kincardine</hi><note n="#11"/> the Author and perfecter of that part of the Invention. But wanting a little addition (which I concealed, and Mr. <persName key="huyg003">Hugens</persName> hath not got yet that I hear of) it failed of the effect that was expected. Notwitstanding this, it was not long after published in <hi rend="i">Low Dutch</hi><note n="#12"/>, and presently after in
<hi rend="i">English</hi><note n="#13"/>; wherein what made for it was related, but what made against it was concealed, though they were both equally known.</p>
<p>But on the otherside, all that I could obtain was a Catalogue of Difficulties, <hi rend="i">first</hi>, in the doing of it, <hi rend="i">secondly</hi> in the bringing it into publick use, <hi rend="i">thirdly</hi>, in making advantage of it. Difficulties were propounded from the alteration of <hi rend="i">Climates</hi>, <hi rend="i">Airs, heats</hi> and <hi rend="i">colds</hi>, temperature of <hi rend="i">Springs</hi>, the nature of <hi rend="i">Vibrations</hi>, the wearing of <hi rend="i">Materials</hi>, the motion of the <hi rend="i">Ship</hi>, and divers others. Next it would be difficult to bring it to use, for Sea-men knew their way already to any <hi rend="i">Port</hi>, and Men would not be at the unnecessary charge of the <hi rend="i">Apparatus</hi>, and observations of the Time could not be well made at Sea, and they would no where be of use but in East and West <hi rend="i">India</hi> Voyages, which were so perfectly understood that every Common Sea-man almost knew how to Pilot a Ship thither. And as for making <hi rend="i">benefit</hi>, all People lost by such undertakings; much had been talkt about the <hi rend="i">Praemiums</hi> for the <hi rend="i">Longitude</hi>, but there was never any such thing, no King or State would ever give a farthing for it, and the like; All which I let pass.</p>
<p>At the earnest importunity of a Dear Friend of mine, since deceased, I did, in the year 1664, read several of my first <hi rend="i">Cutlerian Lectures</hi> upon that Subject, in the open Hall at <hi rend="i">Gresham</hi> Colledge, at which were present, besides a great number of the <hi rend="i">Royal Society</hi>, many Strangers unknown to me, I there shewed the ground and reason of that application of <hi rend="i">Springs</hi> to the <hi rend="i">Ballance</hi> of a Watch, for regulating its motion, and explained briefly the true nature and principle of <hi rend="i">Springs</hi>, to shew the Physical and Geometrical ground of them. And I explained above twenty several ways by which <hi rend="i">Springs</hi> might be applied to do the same thing and how the <hi rend="i">Vibrations</hi> might be so regulated, as to make their Durations either all equal, or the greater slower or quicker than the less, and that in any proportion assigned. Some of these ways were applicable to lesser Vibrations, others to greater, as of 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. or what number of Revolutions were desired; the models of which I there produced, and I did at the same time shew wherein the aforesaid Sea-Clocks were defective.</p>
<p>All these particulars also were at several other times, at the Publick meetings of the <hi rend="i">Royal Society</hi>, discoursed, experimented, and several Models produced. I did also, at the earnest desire of some Friends, in the year 1664 and 1665, cause some of the said Watches to be made, though I was unwilling to add any of the application of the <hi rend="i">Spring</hi> to them, as waiting a better opportunity for my advantage.</p>
<p>Of all these things the Publisher of the <hi rend="i">Transactions</hi> was not ignorant, and I doubt not but Mr. <persName key="huyg003">Hugens</persName> hath had an account, at least he might have read of it in the History of the Royal Society as was enough to have given him notice of it,
for <hi rend="i">page</hi> 247 of that History<note n="#14"/> amongst other Experimented Inventions, there are recounted several new ways of <hi rend="i">Pendulum Watches for the Pocket</hi>, <hi rend="i">wherein the motion is regulated by Springs</hi>, <hi rend="i">&amp;c.</hi> The account of the several ways was given <hi rend="i">somewhat larger to the Learned Author of that excellent History</hi>, though he, as judging it more proper to his design, was pleased to give
only this summary account. Mr. <persName key="huyg003">Hugens</persName> might therefore, if he had pleased, have mentioned the <hi rend="i">first Inventer</hi>, <hi rend="i">Nam ingenuum est fateri;</hi> as he might also that of the Circular Pendulum, which is mentioned in the Same <hi rend="i">page</hi><note n="#15"/> of the aforesaid History.</p>
<p>But though he would not please to confess he knew may published Invention, yet <hi rend="i">I am sure</hi> he hath manifested, that he knows <hi rend="i">no more then what I had formerly discovered</hi>, he having not in [the] least mentioned the other Contrivance, which is the principal, and without which the first part of the Invention is but lame and imperfect, and doth but limp on one leg, and will some time hobble, and stumble and stand still. And the said Watches will not be <hi rend="i">tres-Juste</hi><note n="#16"/> nor shew
the Longitude at Sea or Land, but, on the contrary, they will be subject to most Inequalities of motion and carriage, and with many of those motions will be apt to stand still, whatever to the contrary is affirmed in the <hi rend="i">French Journal</hi> or in the <hi rend="i">English Transactions</hi>.</p>
<p>I forbear now to mention any further the carriage of the Writer<note n="#17"/> of the <hi rend="i">Transactions</hi> in this Affair, and begging my Readers excuse for this digression, I shall conclude this Tract with a short communication of the general ground of my Invention for <hi rend="i">Pocket-Watches</hi>, the number of particular ways being very great, which (that the true Lovers of Art, and they only may have the benefit of it) I have set down in the <hi rend="i">Universal</hi> and <hi rend="i">Real Character</hi> of the late Reverend Prelate, my Honoured Friend Dr. <hi rend="i">John Wilkins</hi><note n="#18"/>, Lord Bishop of Chester, deceased. In which I could wish, that all things of this nature were communicated, it being a Character and Language so truly Philosophical, and so perfectly and thoroughly Methodical, that there seemeth to be nothing wanting to have the utmost perfection, and highest Idea of any Character or Language imaginable, as well for Philosophical as for common and constant use. And I have this further to desire of my Reader, who will be at the pains to decipher and understand this description, that he would only make use of it for his own information, and not communicate the explication thereof to any that hath not had the same curiosity with him self<note n="#19"/>.</p>
<p>This I do, not so much to hinder the spreading of this Description here delivered, as to revive, and, if possible, bring into use and practice that excellent Designe:
It being a Character and Language perfecty free from all manner of ambiguity, and yet the most copious, expressive and significative of any thing or Notion
<figure><graphic url="huyg003oeuv07ill84.gif"></graphic>
<figDesc><hi rend="i">Tabula III</hi>.</figDesc></figure> imaginable, and, which recommends it most to common use, the most easie to be understood and learnt in the World. <hi rend="i">See Table the third</hi><note n="#20"/>.</p>
<p>To fill the vacancy of the ensuing page, I have here added a <hi rend="i">decimate</hi> of the <hi rend="i">centesime</hi> of the Inventions I intend to publish, though possibly not in the same order, but as I can get opportunity and leasure; most of which, I hope, will be as useful to Mankind, as they are yet unknown and new.</p>
