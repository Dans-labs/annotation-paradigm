<div type="letter" id="z1957">
<p>Pray w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> these Notes return my thanks to Mr. <persName key="huyg003">Hugens</persName> for his book.</p>
<p>By a former letter of yo<hi rend="sup">rs</hi>, I was a little dubious whether Mr. <persName key="slus001">Slusius</persName> might not
apprehend by w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you wrote to him concerning me, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I pretended to his Method of drawing tangents; untill I understood by M. Collins y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you signified to him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you thought it here of a later date. ffor it seems to me that he was acquainted w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> it some yeares before he printed his Mesolabum &amp; consequently before I understood it. But if it had been otherwise, yet since he first imparted it to his friends &amp; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, it ought deservedly to be accounted his. As for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Methods they are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same, though I believe derived from different principles. But I know not whether his Principles afford it so generall as mine wh<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> extends to Equations affected w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> surd terms, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>out reducing them to another form. But if you please let this pass<note n="#2"/>.</p>
<p>The incongruities you speak of, I pass by. But I must, as formerly, signify to you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I intend to be no further sollicitous about matters of Philosophy. And therefore I hope you will not take it ill if you find me cease from doing any thing more in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> kind, or rather y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you will favour me in my determination by preventing so far as you can conveniently any objections or other philosophical letters, that may concern me. For your profer about my Quarterly payments I thank you. But would not have you trouble yo<hi rend="sup">r</hi> self to get them excused if you have not done it already. And now being tired w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> this long letter, I must in haste write my self.</p>
