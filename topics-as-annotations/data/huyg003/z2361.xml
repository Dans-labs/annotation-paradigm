<p>Leyden, Aug. 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> (N.S.) 1684.</p>
</div>
<p>The 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of this month, having the opportunity of a gentleman my acquaintance's company, I made the other journey to the Hague, in hopes to see Mr. <persName key="huyg003">Huygens</persName>, which I did, and was received extraordinary civilly by him. After some discourse,
understanding I was an Englishman, he, beyond my expectations, talked to me in my own language, and pretty well. He carried me up into his study, where he showed me a most curious mechanical movement of his own contrivance. As I remember, I told you something of this that I had heard by report, in one of my letters whilst I was in England; but now you may take the following account from me as an eye-witness, but you must think I could not have time in that short period while I stayed with him, (wich in all was not above an hour and a half,) to look nicely on every part in't, nor could I civilly be so inquisitive, and ask so many questions of one that was a perfect stranger to me, at my first visit, as thoroughly to make me understand the motion and all its parts; so you must be content with what I observed then, and can remember now, which is as follows: - It stands up against the wall like a clock<note n="#4"/>. The outward dial-plate, where the great circle of the ecliptick is described, containing within it all those of the planets, placed according to the hypothesis of <persName>Copernicus</persName>, is about two foot square. This shows you at once the minute, hour, day of the month and year, with the exact postures and aspects that all the planets bear to the sun and one another at that very moment, and also the site of the satellites in respect of their middle planets, viz. the three of ♄, and the four of ♃ - these and all the planets absolve their course, just in the same time as they do in the heavens. Here you have all retrogradations, excentricitys, and other irregular motions described. He told me that in 1682, when Saturn and Jupiter were in conjunction several times by their retrograde motion<note n="#5"/>, that they were so just as often in his
machine as in the heavens. He has not here (for he could [not] with convenience) made the planets, and the diameter of these circles they describe answer according to that proportion they truly bear to one another; but this he has done by a smaller scheme in one corner of his plate, according to the latest observations he and the Parisian astronomers could make. He complained much that the motion of Saturn was not yet certainly regulated by any of the astronomers. I observed its motion was far more excentrick on his plate than any of the rest of the planets. In the inside 't is a very plain piece of work, consisting of not above eight or nine wheels. As I could discern, the chief or principle motion that sets these agoing is not a pendulum, but a balance regulated by springs, as those of pendulum watches are. He can with a key turn the whole engine about, (wich he did,) and set all the wheels agoing, so as to put it to any day that is to come for these three hundred years, and so find out how the posture of the planets will be then. Yet after all this, 'tis nothing more than an ingenious curiosity, and is so far srom being so exact as to supply the place of ephemerides as I imagine 'tis of little or no use at all; for I asked him could he by help of it exactly determine an ecclipse, and I observed he would not give me a positive answer, as being loath to confess the imperfections of his contrivance to me that seemed to admire it so much as I did. You may see such a sort of an engine described in your last volume of the ‘Journal des Scavans’, in the first month<note n="#6"/>. After this he carried me into his garden and showed me every particular thing belonging to his
contrivance which he describes in that little tract I sent you by my last<note n="#7"/>. His object-glass, of which he speaks there, he estimates much. 'Tis of both sides convex, and, as he told me, ground by himself. Within these two months he has seen several spots in the sun<note n="#8"/>, I would have you observe whether you can discern any in your glasses.’</p>
