<p>Sir,</p>
</div>
<p>It is very sure, that Mr. <persName key="neil020">William Neil</persName> had in the year 1657 found out and demonstrated a Streight line equal to a Paraboloeid; and did then communicate and publish the same (though not in print) to my self and others, who used to meet at <hi rend="i">Gresham</hi> Colledge, and it was there received with good approbation; and the same was, presently afterwards, otherwise demonstrated by my self and others: And therefore ancienter than that of Monsieur <hi rend="i">Heurat</hi>, which (as it seems) is not pretended to have been done before the year 1659<note n="#2"/>; and ancienter too than that of Sr. <hi rend="i">Ch. Wren</hi>, finding a Streight line equal to a Cycloid in the year 1658; and by him admitted so to be. Nor ought it at all to prejudice <persName>Neil</persName>, that M. <persName>Heuraet</persName>'s was somewhat sooner abroad in print, than that of M. <hi rend="i">Neil</hi>, (though both in the same year 1659;) since it is well known to many of us, that Mr. <persName>Neil</persName>'s was done before. Otherwise M. <hi rend="i">Hugens</hi>, by the same reason, will grant the precedency to <hi rend="i">Heuraet</hi>, of that which he now claims to be his own invention (that Rectifying the Parabolical Line and Squaring the Hyperbolical Space do mutually depend on each other:) for this was published in print by M. <hi rend="i">Heuraet</hi> (or M. <hi rend="i">Schooten</hi> for him) in the year 1659<note n="#3"/>, and not by M. <hi rend="i">Hugens</hi> till now, 1673: And yet M. <hi rend="i">Hugens</hi> thinks, the may well claim that invention to be his own, because he now tells us<note n="#4"/>, that he found it out about the end
of the year 1657, and did (some time after) communicate it privately to some friends. And whereas, he doth suppose, that this invention of his might give occasion to that other of <hi rend="i">Heuraet</hi>, we may also as well suppose, that he might have taken such occasion from hearing of M. <hi rend="i">Neil</hi> having done the like, (for this had been then commonly known for a great while:) Or might have taken occasion (as well as Mr. <persName>Neil</persName>) from that of Dr. <hi rend="i">Wallis Schol. prop.</hi> 38. <hi rend="i">Arith. Infin.</hi> or from that of Sr. <hi rend="i">Ch. Wren</hi> having found a Steright equal to another Curve the year before: Or, if it were necessary to know their symbolization between the Parabolical Line and the Hyperbolical Space, he might have had it earlier from Dr. <hi rend="i">Wallis</hi>. For, when
he had demonstrated (<hi rend="i">Schol. pr op.</hi> 38. <hi rend="i">Ar. Infin.</hi>) that the Particles which compose the Parabolical line, are in power equal to a <hi rend="i">Series</hi> of Squares increased by a series of Equals, suppose √ ∶ A<hi rend="sup">2</hi> + b<hi rend="sup">2</hi>: And (<hi rend="i">prop.</hi> 35, 41. <hi rend="i">Conic</hi>. <hi rend="i">Sect</hi>.) that <hi rend="i">c</hi> the Ordinates to the Conjugate Diameter of an Hyperbola, (that is, the particles of which that Hyperbolical space consisteth,) are so also, <hi rend="i">viz.</hi> √∶ 1/4 T<hi rend="sup">2</hi> + T/L h<hi rend="sup">2</hi>: (where <hi rend="i">A</hi>, <hi rend="i">T</hi>, <hi rend="i">L</hi>, are permanent quantities, and <hi rend="i">b</hi>, <hi rend="i">h</hi>, taken successively in Progression Arithmetical;) It was easie (for M. <hi rend="i">Heuraet</hi>, or M. <hi rend="i">Hugens</hi>, or any other,) to infer, That, if we can Rectifie the one, we may Square the other, <hi rend="i">&amp; vice versa</hi>. But from whence soever M. <hi rend="i">Heuraet</hi> had it; we may, as before, reasonably conclude, that Mr. <persName>Neil</persName> had it before him: And M. <hi rend="i">Hugens</hi> is a person of that ingenuity, that, when he shall better consider of it, he will (I doubt not) be of the same mind.</p>
