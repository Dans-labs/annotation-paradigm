<p>Mr. <persName key="newt011">Newton</persName>, june 23. 73<note n="#2"/>.</p>
<p>I receiued y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> lettres w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Monsr. <persName key="huyg003">Hugens</persName> his kind present, for w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I pray you return him my humble thanks. I haue view'd it w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> great satisfaction, finding
it full of very subtile and usefull speculations very worthy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Author. I am glad, we are to exspect another discours of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> <hi rend="i">Vis centrifuga</hi>, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> speculation may prove of good use in natural Philosophy and Astronomy, as well as Mechanicks.</p>
<p>In the Demonstration of prop. 8. de <hi rend="i">Descensu gravium</hi>, there seems to be an
Illegitimat supposition, namly, That y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> flexures at B and C do not hinder y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> motion of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> descending body<note n="#3"/>. For in reality they will hinder it, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> a body, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> descends from A, shall not acquire so great velocity when arrived to D, as one w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> descends from E. If this supposition be made, because a body descending by a curve line meets w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> no such opposition, and this Proposition is laid down in order to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contemplation of motion in curve lines; then it should have been shown, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though rectilinear flexures do hinder, yet the infinitly litle flexures w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are in curves, though infinit in number, do not at all hinder the motion.</p>
<p>The rectifying curve lines by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> way w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> M. Hugens calls Evolution, I haue been sometimes considering also, and haue met w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> a way of resolving it w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> seemes more ready and free from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> trouble of calculation than y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of M. Hugens. If he please, I will send it him<note n="#4"/>. The Problem also is capable of being improved by being propounded thus more generally;</p>
<p>‘Curvas invenire quotascunque, quarum longitudines cum propositae alicujus curvae longitudine, vel cum area ad datam lineam applicatâ, comparari possunt.</p>
<p><note n="#5"/> Concerning y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> busines of <hi rend="i">Colors</hi>, I have this to return, that in my saying, <hi rend="i">when M. Hugens had shown</hi>, <hi rend="i">how white may be produced out of two vncompounded colors</hi>, <hi rend="i">I would tell him</hi>, <hi rend="i">why he can conclude nothing from that</hi>; my meaning was, That such a white (were there any such) would haue different proporties from the white of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Sun's immediat light, of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ordinary objects of our Senses, and of all white phaenomena y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> haue hitherto falne vnder my observation. And those different properties would evince it to be of a different constitution; In somuch y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> such a production of <hi rend="i">white</hi> would be so far from contradicting, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it would rather illustrate and confirme my Theory; because by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difference of <hi rend="i">that</hi> from other whites it would appear, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other whites are not compounded of only two colors like that. And therefore, if M. Hugens would prove any thing, 't is

requisite y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he do not only produce out of two Primitive colors a White, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> naked ey shall appear like other whites, but also shall agree w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> him in all other proporties.</p>
<p>But to let you vnderstand, wherein such a white would differ from other whites, and why from thence it would follow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> other whites are otherwise compounded, I shall lay down this position;</p>
<p>‘That a compounded colour can be resolved into no more simple colors than those of wich it is compounded’.</p>
<p>This seems to be self-evident; and I haue also tryed it several ways, and particularly
<figure><graphic url="huyg003oeuv07ill66.gif"></graphic></figure>
by this w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> follows. Let <hi rend="i">α</hi> represent an oblong piece of white papier about ½ or ¼ of an inch broad, and illuminated in a dark room with a mixture of two colors cast vpon it from two Prismes, suppose a deep Blew and Scarlet, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> must severally be as vncompounded as they can conveniently be made. Then at a convenient distance, suppose of 6 or 8 yards, view it through a clear triangular glass or crystal Prism, held parallel to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paper and you shall see y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> two colors parted from one another in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fashion of two images of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paper, as they are represented at <hi rend="i">β</hi> and <hi rend="i">γ</hi>, where suppose <hi rend="i">β</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> scarlet, and <hi rend="i">γ</hi> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blew without green or any other colour between y<hi rend="sup">m</hi>.</p>
<p>Now from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afores<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Position I deduce these two conclusions: 1. That if there were found out a way to compound white of 2 simple colors only, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> white would be again resolvable into no more than two. 2. That if other whites (as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Suns light etc) be resolvable into more than two simple colors (as I find by Experient that they are) then they must be compounded of more than two.</p>
<p>To make this plainer, suppose, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> A represents a white body illuminated by a direct beam of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sun transmitted through a smal hole into a dark room, and <hi rend="i">α</hi> such an other body illuminated by a mixture of two simple colors, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> if possible, may make it also appear of a white color exactly like A. Then at a convenient distance view these two whites through a Prisme, and A will be changed into a series of all colors, Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, Purple, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> their intermediat degrees succeeding in order from B to C. But <hi rend="i">α</hi>, according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> afores<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Experiment, will only yield those two colors of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> 'twas compounded, and those not conterminat like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colors at B C but separate from one another, as at <hi rend="i">β</hi> and <hi rend="i">γ</hi> by means of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> different refrangibility of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rays to w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they belong. And thus by comparing these two whites, they would appear to be of a different constitution, and A to consist of more colors than <hi rend="i">α</hi>. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> what M. Hugens contends for, would rather advance my Theory by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> access of a new kind of white, than conclude ag<hi rend="sup">st</hi> it. But I see no hopes of compounding such a white.</p>
<p>As for M. Hugens expression, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I maintain my doctrine with some concern<note n="#6"/>, I confess it was a litle vngratefull to me to meet w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> objections w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> had been answer'd before, wi<hi rend="sup">th</hi>out having y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least reason giuen me why those Answers were insufficient. The Answers, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I speake of, are in the Transactions<note n="#7"/> from pag. 5093 to 5102; And particularly in p. 5095, to show y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there are other simple colors besides Blew and Yellow, I instance in a simple or homogeneal Green, such as cannot be made by mixing Blew and Yellow or any other colors. And there also I show, why, supposing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> all colors might be produced out of two, yet it would not follow, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> those two are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only original colors. The reasons I desire you would compare w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> what hath been now said of White. And so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> necessity of all colors to produce white might haue appear'd by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Experiment p. 5097. where I say, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> if any color at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lens be intercepted, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whitenes (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is compounded of them all) will be changed into (y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> result of) other colors.</p>
<p>However, since there seems to haue happen'd some misvnderstanding between us, I shall endeavor to explaine myself a litle further in these things according to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> following method.</p>
<div type="section">
<head rend="h4">Definitions.</head>
<p>1. I call y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Light homogeneal, similar or uniform, whose rays are equally refrangible.</p>
<p>2. And y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> heterogenial, whose rays are vnequally refrangible.</p>
<p>Note. There are but three affections of Light in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I haue observed its rayes to differ, viz. Refrangibility, Reflexibility and Color; and those rays w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> agree in refrangibility, agree also in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other two, and therefore may well be defined homogeneal; especially since men usually call those things homogeneal, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are so in all qualities y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> come vnder their knowledge, though in other qualities, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there knowledge extends not to, there may possibly be some heterogeneity.</p>
<p>3. Those Colors I call simple, or homogeneal, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are exhibited by homogeneal light.</p>
<p>4. And those compound or heterogeneal, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are exhibited by heterogeneal light.</p>
<p>5. Different colors I call not only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more eminent species, viz. Yellow, Green, Blew, Purple, but all other y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> minutest gradations: much after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same manner y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> not only y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more eminent degrees in musick, but all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> least gradations are esteem'd different sounds.</p>
<p>Propositions.</p>
<p>1. The suns Light consists of rays differing by indefinit degrees of refrangibility.</p>
<p>2. Rays w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> differ in refrangibility when parted from one another, do proportionaly differ in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> colors w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they exhibit. These 2 Propositions are matter of fact.</p>
<p>3. There are as many simple or homogeneal colors as degrees of refrangibility. For, to every degree of refrangibility belongs a different color by Prop. 2. And that color is simple, by Defin. 1 and 3.</p>
<p>4. Whitenes, in all respects like that of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Suns immediate light and of all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> usual objects of our Senses, cannot be compounded of two simple colors alone. For, such a composition must be made by rays y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> have only two degrees of refrangibility, by Def. 1 and 3, and therefore it cannot be like y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> suns light, by Prop. 1, nor for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same reason like y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of ordinary white objects.</p>
<p>5. Whitenes, in all respects like y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Suns immediat light, cannot be compounded of simple colors, w<hi rend="sup">th</hi>out an indifinit variety of y<hi rend="sup">m</hi>. For, to such a composition there are requisit rays indued w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> indefinit degrees of refrangibility by Prop. 1. And those inferr as many simple colors, by Def. 1 and 3. and Prop. 2 and 3.</p>
<p>To make these a litle plainer, I haue added also y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Propositions y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> follow.</p>
<p>6. The rays of light do not act on one another in passing through the same medium. This appears by several passages in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Transactions p. 5097. 5098. 5100. and 5101. and is capable of further proof.</p>
<p>7. The rays of light suffer not any change of their qualities from refraction.</p>
<p>8. Nor afterwards from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> adjacent quiet medium.</p>
<p>These two propositions are manifest de facto in homogeneal light, whose color and refrangibility is not at all changeable either by refraction or by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contermination of a quiet medium. And as for heterogeneal light, it is but an aggregat of several sorts of homogeneal light, no one sort of w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> suffers any more alteration, than if it were alone, because y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rays act not on one another by Prop. 6. And therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aggregate can suffer none. These two Propositions also might be further proved apart by Experiments too long to be here described.</p>
<p>9. There can no homogeneal colors be educed out of light by refraction, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> were not commixt in it before; because, by prop. 7. &amp; 8, Refraction changes not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> qualities of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rays, but only separates those w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> haue divers qualities, by means of their different refrangibility.</p>
<p>10. The Suns light is an aggregat of an indefinit variety of homogeneal colors, by prop. 1. 3. and 9. And hence it is y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I call homogeneal colors also primitive or original. And thus much concerning colors<note n="#8"/>.</p>
<p>M. Hugens has thought fit to insinuate, that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aberration of rays (by their disserent refrangibility) is not so considerable a disadvantage in Glasses as I seem'd to be willing to make men belieue, when I propounded concave mirrors as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> only hopes of perfecting Telescopes. But if he please to take his pen, and compute ye errors of a glas and speculum that collect rays at equal distances, he will find, how much he is mistaken, and y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I haue not been extravagant, as he imagins, in preferring reflexions<note n="#9"/>. And as for what he says os y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> difficulty of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> praxis, I know it is very difficult, and by those ways w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he attempted it, I believe it vnpracticable. But there is a way insinuated in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Transactions p. 3080<note n="#10"/>, by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> it is not improbable but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as much may be done in large Telescopes, as I haue thereby done in short ones, but yet not without more than ordinary diligence and curiosity<note n="#11"/>.</p>
