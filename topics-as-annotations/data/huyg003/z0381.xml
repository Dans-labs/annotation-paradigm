<p>I have received your second letter<note n="#2"/> by Mr. <persName>Dewerts</persName><note n="#3"/> wherin I find: your dissatisfaction of ye opinion of those little glasses. truly Arts are as obscure and hard to finde out by those yt are unlerned in them, as Natures Workes; but to cleer my Opinion, or rather to answer yours desires I shall Argue something more of them: though my Arguments may be as weake as my Opinions, &amp; my opinions as weake as my Judgement, &amp; my Judgement as weake as want of Knowlledge can make itt.</p>
<p>As for your Liquor you say in your Letter that if itt were a Sulphurous
Liquor, or a Liquid gunpowder (as I said) I thought it might bee, doubtlesse it would be actiue by ye help of fire; I answer for that, fire hath seuerall Actiue Effects both in itt selfe and uppon other Substances; or subjects wherfore if ye Liquor had ben dry powder it might be subiect to yt effect of fire, as to flash, flame, or bounce, but if ye powder were wett the fire could worke noe such effects, but as ye substance is A Liquor fire is as subiect to yt Substance, or matter as that substance or matter is to fire, for all Liquors allthough strong with Spirritts and hott in operation will quench fire as sudenly as fire shall euapporate Liquor take quantity for quantity and it is probable yt the high fire you did Applye to ye glasse, did eueporat out ye Licquor in the glasse which might be ye weakening &amp; changing or altering the former effects. Alsoe you say you cannot perceiue ye buble to be a Licquor. I answer that it is probable the Licquor, if any be therin was euaporated out either by ye fire, you applyed or by ye vent of passage, which may soone turne itt into vapor by reason of ye litle quantitye yt is in a glasse. thus it might be wasted before ye truth could possible be found out: for certainly to my sense, as alsoe to my reason A Licquor Apeared to be in those glasses, you sent me; but if there be noe Licquor in those glasses, then it is probable it might be pent [?] up ayre enclosed therin, which hauing vent was ye cause of the sound, or report which those glasses gaue.</p>
<p>Thus Sir you may perceiue by my Argueings, I striue to make my former opinion, or sense good. Allthough I doe not binde my selfe to opinions, but truth; and ye truth is that though I cannot finde out ye truth of ye glasses; yet In-truth I am</p>
