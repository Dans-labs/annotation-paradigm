<p>December 15. 1664.</p>
<p>Most honoured Sir</p>
</div>
<p>This letter<note n="#1"/> coming so late to the posthouse on Tuesday night, was brought back to me, since which I have made farther trial of Monsieur Zulichem's experiment, and both my lord Brouncker, Sir R. Moray and Dr. Wren, were judges and examiners of the experiment, and find, that the trials made with these pendulums, whose balls were of lignum vitae, did not answer to Mr. <persName>Zulichem</persName>'s rule, and therefore it is now much doubted of<note n="#2"/>. We had yesterday in several parts of England, an account of the appearance of a very great comet<note n="#3"/> in the south south-east, with a very long tail, extended towards the north-west; some say about ten yards long, some about two; but how much that is, is difficult to guess, unless we could see it, which I have done all this last night, but to little purpose, by reason of the thickness of the air. It has been seen in Yorkshire, and in Cheshire, and at Portsmouth<note n="#4"/>, and several other parts of England. I this day got a sight of Master Faithorne's plate<note n="#5"/>, and indeed he has done the face very carefully and well; and, I think, very like; but has not quite finished the plate. The other cuts are finished for your book of Cold<note n="#6"/>; but Master Thompson has again disappointed me. Your anatomical experiments, read by Monsieur Oldenburg<note n="#7"/>, were very highly approved of by the whole Society. I cannot yet perfect my telescope glasses, though they do now very much more flatter me with hopes than at first, so that I shall not yet give over. It seems, by some
papers of Monsieur <persName key="olde010">Oldenbourg</persName>, that they have made in France object glasses of 250 palms, which is about 160 feet long, and make use of them without a tube<note n="#8"/>.</p>
