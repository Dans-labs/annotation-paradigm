<p>Extract of Mister <persName key="boyl001">Boyle</persName>'s letter<note n="#1"/> for Mister <persName key="huyg003">Zulichem</persName>.</p>
<p>The Observations<note n="#2"/> from Mister Zulichem I haue communicated to Doctor Wallis, and mean to doe so to Doctor Wren, as soon as I see him, they are very ingenious and worthy to be prosecuted and of ye author, concerning whom I forgot to tell you formerly, that I was not a little proud to receiue in his letter<note n="#3"/> to Sir R. Moray, from so competent a Judge so favorable a Character of my Trefles about colors<note n="#4"/>. And as for what he mentions of ye Iris producible betwixt 2 pieces of flat Glasse without ye assistance of a liquor, I am much obliged to him for ye mentioning it. But though I had severall times observed it, before my Book came out; yet by reason of certain scruples, I had about ye cause of it, I purposely forbore to take notice of that and another Phaenomenon somewhatt of kin vnto it. And as for ye Question, He desires to haue of Sir J Finch concerning the Blind man<note n="#5"/>, as I think myselfe obliged to Mister Zulichem for ye occasion of it, so by ye Circumstances of Sir John<note n="#6"/>, related to me of ye Extraordinary Care, he tooke not to be imposed upon, I am invited to exspect, that He will be able to giue a satisfactory answer to it<note n="#7"/>.</p>
