<p>Decembre 13. 1664.</p>
<p>Most honoured Sir,</p>
</div>
<p>I am not only ashamed, that I have not sooner given you an account of what I promised in my last<note n="#2"/>, but much more, that I am able as yet to say so little to the
purpose; for though, when I last writ, I was promised, both by Master Faithorne<note n="#3"/>
<figure><graphic url="huyg003oeuv05ill17.gif"></graphic></figure>
and Master Thompson<note n="#4"/>, that I should have those things which they had in their hands, finished within three or four days; and though I have often called upon them, and urged them all I could, I have not been able to get them done. I have lately observed many circumstances in the height of the mercurial cylinder, which do very much cross my former observations; for at this very time the quicksilver is as high as I have a long time observed it, and I don't remember, that it has been higher: it has risen a little for these four or five days, and has continued so, notwithstanding the variety of winds, and the multitude of rain, that has lately fallen; and, I think, it rises a little yet, but it is but little.</p>
<p>I have taken notice also of two or three other very odd particulars lately in it, which have crossed several other observations. The experiments we are now most busy about<note n="#5"/>, are concerning the adjustening of the length of pendulums, thereby to settle a common standard for length; of which kind, Monsieur Zulichem has sent over<note n="#6"/> some very pretty theories; but upon very careful trial with several accurate and large pendulums, made with balls of lignum vitae<note n="#7"/>, some of which balls are six inches over, others no bigger than the head of a pin, or a small shot, and suspended by a very curious hair, which seems as likely a way as any to find out to what point of the globular body, hung at the end of a string, the length of such a pendulum is to be reckoned. Monsieur Zulichem says, it is ⅖ parts of a third proportional below the center of the ball <hi rend="i">c</hi>, the first of which proportionals are, <hi rend="i">ab</hi> + <hi rend="i">bc</hi> (that is, <hi rend="i">ac</hi>) and <hi rend="i">bc</hi>; namely, <hi rend="i">ab</hi> + <hi rend="i">bc</hi>, <hi rend="i">bc</hi> ∷ <hi rend="i">bc</hi>; <hi rend="i">bc bc/ab</hi> + <hi rend="i">bc</hi>, which we will suppose <hi rend="i">ce</hi>; ⅖ of which taken below the centre gives <hi rend="i">d</hi> the point, to which the length of the pendulum <hi rend="i">ad</hi> is to be measured from <hi rend="i">a</hi>, the point of suspension. Sure it is, that this point is below <hi rend="i">c</hi>, the center of the body; but whether at <hi rend="i">d</hi>, I cannot positively yet affirm.</p>
<p>The plate for your book<note n="#8"/> was graven before I received your last of Monsieur Evelyn's. I have only taken notice of seven instruments, which you in those sheets I looked on have described; and those I so put into one small plate, that they will fold out of the book, when there is occasion. This last of Monsieur Evelyn<note n="#9"/> I have given a small draught of also to the engraver, who is not an Englishman, but one that I find a very good workman, and very punctual to his word; which was the reason I did not employ Master Faithorne, as you directed, he having so very often and often disappointed my expectation. I have since my last made an anatomy of a dog, and hope, that I have made a considerable new discovery; but this being the first time I have seen it, at least taken notice of it, I cannot, till further trial, positively affirm any thing, which, as soon as ever I am assured of it, you shall thereof receive an account from,</p>
<p>Sir</p>
<p>Your most faithful and most humble servant <persName key="hook001">R. Hooke</persName>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope, Sir, you will pardon this hasty scribble, for it was very near eleven a clock this night, before I could get from some company, met<note n="#10"/> about the business of Sir J. Cutler.</p>
