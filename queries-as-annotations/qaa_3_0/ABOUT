Queries As Annotations

Demo app by DataArchiving And Networked Services
http://www.dans.knaw.nl

version 1.0: queries as annotations

version 2.0: features as annotations

version 2.1: highlight settings can be saved and loaded

version 3.0: the anchors for words have changed: no longer the monad number, but a string specifying book-chapter-verse and then the word count in that verse.

This is version 3.0
